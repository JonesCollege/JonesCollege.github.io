            <h1>Mary Gibbs Jones Birthday Bash</h1>
            <p>
            The Jones Birthday Bash is a day where all Jonesians come together to celebrate our beloved college with lots of food, games, fun, and animals. It is a day where we can express our love for Jones and everything we enjoy about it! Associates and alumni are also invited to join the festivities. In years past, we have had baby goats, puppies, bounce houses, water slides, human hamster balls, and more! There's always plenty of great food, including Torchy's Tacos, burgers hot off the grill, and of course the popcorn, snow cone, and cotton candy machines!
