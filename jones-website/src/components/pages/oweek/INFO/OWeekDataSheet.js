  text: "We are Samy, Arryana, and Sammy, also known as Team MaripoSAS, and we are super excited to serve as your Orientation Week Coordinators! We’ve spent so much time planning this magical O-Week just for YOU!\n\n As your Coordinators, or better known as Coords, our mission is to make your transition to college as smooth as possible, making sure that each and every one of you has an opportunity to showcase the unique abilities you bring to Jones and Rice as a whole. From August 18th to the 24th, our goal will be to introduce you to all the resources you can access at Jones and at Rice so that you can succeed and make your mark here! \n\n Rice's Orientation-Week, otherwise known as “O-Week”, is unique and distinguished from orientation programs at other universities. Broadly, events in O-Week can be divided into three ways: events that help you plan your classes and prepare for them, events that describe the resources you have at Rice and beyond, and events that help you get to know the family of Jones and of Rice! \n\n And if you’re worried about bringing anything or being prepared for any of this, don’t worry – this book, and the people around you during this exciting week, will help you to know exactly what to bring, and what to expect at any given moment. It’s okay if you don’t have everything figured out right now – what classes to take, what clubs to join, where you want to end up after graduating – as your Coords, and as part of your O-Week Team, we’ll help you find your magic together. \n\n The very first people you’ll meet during O-Week will be your Advisors, a hand-picked, diverse, engaged, and trained group of upperclassmen who volunteer part of their summer to learn how to best introduce you to Jones. (You can find your Advisors in this book.) Every freshman is paired with 4-5 Advisors and 8-10 other freshmen, who all together form an “O-Week Family”. This group is not only a major part of your O-Week, but also your whole first year — you’ll check in on each other, share meals weekly, and find the answers to any questions you may have. As the saying here at Rice goes, O-Week is forever.\n\n Jones itself is full of life, spirit, and most importantly, family. These elements of Jones led us to this year’s O-Week theme! EncantO-Week is dedicated to fostering an O-Week experience that places community and individuality at its core. Having walked through the dazzling Sallyport ourselves to meet thousands of people from all walks and parts of life, we understand how stressful coming into college can be. \n\n As we approach O-Week, you might have some questions like: what do I wear to classes? Do I ask permission to use the restroom in classes? What career path am I choosing? What is my true passion? But even in this new place with new people, we want you to not be timid about showing your true self at Rice! As beautiful and as enchanting this university is, each and every one of you is even more special. Whether it’s joining a club, taking a class, or making new friends, we want you to use your uniqueness, or inner magic, to navigate your college experience during and after O-Week. And we want you to know that in this journey, the Jones familia will always be there to support you and love you! Remember, the magic is within yourself! \n\nLook through this book to learn more, and don’t hesitate to reach out to us for any concerns or questions. We’ll be waiting with open arms and hearts! See you soon!\n\n With enchantment,\n\n",
