        <p> Hey Jones! We are your Rice Health Advisors, a peer resource trained to assist you with wellbeing needs in college. We’ve
            all participated  in a semester-long class at Rice to  receive training  and receive on-going training throughout the year
            on the following topics:  </p>

        <p> We work closely with the Rice Counseling and Wellness Centers (and our A-Team!) in order to provide direct support to our
            college through year-long programming, one-on-one support, and office hours concerning anything and everything related to
            your wellbeing! Although we have designated office hour times, you can reach out to us individually at any time. Our
            intention with office hours is to provide clear opportunities for students to come to us if they are hesitant about
            reaching out to us at a random time. But seriously, reach out whenever!
            <br></br>

            We are well trained, but we are not experts. So, if there’s something we don’t know about, we’ll know who to refer you to
            instead and support you through the process. We handle all conversations with confidentiality unless we see a peer in a
            situation of immediate danger.
