I'm so excited to have the opportunity to be president this year, as we are hoping to both revitalize many of our favorite traditions and cultures following COVID while also reimagining the way in which the college is run. Community inclusion is my biggest priority this year, and I'm excited to see the ways in which Jones can continue to be a home away from home for all of its students."
