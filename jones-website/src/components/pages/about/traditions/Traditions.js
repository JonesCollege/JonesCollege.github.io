                    <h3>Mary Gibbs Jones Birthday Bash</h3>
                    <p className=''>The Jones Birthday Bash is a day where all Jonesians come together to celebrate our beloved college 
                    with lots of food, games, fun, and animals. It is a day where we can express our love for Jones and everything we 
                    enjoy about it! Associates and alumni are also invited to join the festivities. In years past, we have had baby 
                    goats, puppies, bounce houses, water slides, human hamster balls, and more! There's always plenty of great food, 
                    including Torchy's Tacos, burgers hot off the grill, and of course the popcorn, snow cone, and cotton candy machines!</p>

                    <h3>Freshman Hunger Games</h3>
                    <p className=''>In the fiercest and most deadly battle of Floor Olympics, freshmen from each floor are offered up as 
                    tributes to battle for the honor of their floor. Chosen at a reaping alongside an upperclassman mentor, one freshman girl 
                    and one freshman boy must prepare themselves for the greatest challenge of their life. However, one female and one male OC 
                    (off-campus) student are also selected to be the â€œcareers" of the battle. To show support for their tributes, floor-mates 
                    win points to purchase gifts  by demonstrating their knowledge and creativity for the Hunger Games. You will not want to 
                    miss this epic war complete with swords (noodles), guns (water guns), and blood (red paint)! </p>

                <h3>Floor Olympics</h3>
                <p className=''>A house divided against itself. Jones Floor Olympics is an annual tradition in which each floor competes 
                against one another to prove themselves as the most dominant. In the past, competitions have included: volleyball, dodgeball, 
                trivia, the Jones Hunger Games, and many more! Floors receive points based on where they rank in each competition, and the 
                floor with the most points at the end of the year receives a monetary prize to spend however they so choose. Get excited to 
                bond with your floor-mates and show other Jonesians your athleticism and wits!</p>
