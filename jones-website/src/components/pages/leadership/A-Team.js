            <h1>The A-Team</h1>
            <h3>The Magisters</h3>
            <h2>Jason and Jennifer Trotter</h2>
            <p>hafner@rice.edu • jentrot@rice.edu</p>
            <p>We are Jason Hafner and Jennifer Trotter, the Jones College Magisters. Undergraduate students at Rice are assigned 
                to one of eleven residential colleges where they live or associate for their entire time at the university.  Jones 
                is home to about 300 students, and we are honored to serve in this position. Our family lives in the Jones House 
                on campus right next door to the residential halls. As Magisters, we advise and assist students as they run the 
                college, and we host events to support Jones's intellectual, social, and cultural environment. We celebrate Jones's 
                inevitable and numerous victories, and we are there to support students through the occasional setbacks.
                <br />We met as undergraduates at Trinity University in San Antonio. Jason came to Rice for graduate school in physics 
                while Jennifer opted for the lush environs of the Texas Tech School of Medicine. After a brief stint in Boston, 
                we made our way back to Rice. Jason is a Professor of Physics and Astronomy where he runs a molecular biophysics 
                research group, teaches introductory physics courses, and helps keep Rice running smoothly - but he will gladly 
                forsake all of that to help a student. Jennifer is a pediatrician working in a suburb of Houston. She is an avid 
                runner and enjoys running marathons - especially when they are somewhere fun. She would be glad to have you join 
                her on a morning run, but you need to be ready to go at 5:00 am! Our boys, George and Henry, are active in fencing, 
                cross country, music, reading, and video games. Pretty standard, really. Finally, there's our dog Freddie HG Hafner.  
                His interests are simple: treats and walks. We hope to see you around Jones sometime!</p>
            <h3>College Coordinator</h3>
            <h2>Michelle Bennack</h2>
            <p>mrb4@rice.edu</p>
            <p>Hello and welcome to Jones College! <br />
                My name is Michelle Bennack, and I am the Jones College Coordinator. I hold 
                the keys to the kingdom of Jones so to speak. My office is located in “central” on the first floor by the Commons. 
                As the coordinator, I am here to help you through your college years and provide you with a variety of things: your mail, 
                packages from home, stamps, envelopes, faxes, photocopies, answers to your queries, and so much more! <br />
                The office is a great place to hang out (there are great sofas in here) and take a breather in your day. You 
                can jump on the office computer to print your plane tickets, homework and such. If you're lacking in energy, 
                answer the daily quiz for candy correctly and you will be rewarded with a delicious treat. Also chilling in 
                the office everyday is my golden retriever, Beau. He gives great hugs and plays a mean game of tug-o-war. Stop in anytime!</p>
            <h3>Jones North RA</h3>
            <h2>James Atkins</h2>
            <p>jda9@rice.edu</p>
            <p>James isn't from Texas, but he got here as soon as he could! A Midwestern native (Euchre, anyone?), he earned his degrees in 
                Communication Studies and Organizational and Professional Communication Development from Ball State University, often referred 
                to as the Harvard of Muncie, Indiana. Prior to starting at Rice in the fall of 2016, he dabbled in food banking, higher education 
                public relations, and college admissions at his alma mater.<br />
                At Rice, James is the Deputy Director of Enrollment Marketing and Communications, and works with a dream team of professionals who 
                introduce Rice to high school students and their families all over the world. He's responsible for recruitment in New England and 
                gets to travel there a few times a year, so if you're from the Northeast and have restaurant recommendations, please share! <br />
                When he's not at work, you can find James at Miller Outdoor Theatre, Minute Maid Park (Go 'Stros!), or in the theatre district downtown, 
                undoubtedly with a ticket he got for super cheap or free (b/c that's his jam). His love for Houston is longer than the line at Ramen 
                Tatsu-Ya on a Friday, wider than the Katy Freeway at Beltway 8, and bigger than the Houston Livestock Show and Rodeo in March. 
                He's a big fan of RuPaul's Drag Race and lives for a good strategy game. He's pumped to be at Jones, the winningest college at Rice!</p>
            <h3>Jones South RA</h3>
            <h2>Kerri Barber</h2>
            <p>klb8@rice.edu</p>
            <p>Kerri is a BoSox lovin', Yankee hating, country music parrot-head that uses “wicked” and “y'all” in the same sentence. Kerri earned her B.S. 
                in Sport Management from Ithaca College and was a member of the 2002 NCAA DIII National Championship softball team. Kerri is such a 
                competitive player she thought it would be a great idea to play in the championship series with a busted ankle and broken nose (hey a fancy 
                ring was worth it right?!?) < br/>
                After spending four years bundled up in blankets and snow suits, Kerri realized she wanted to spend her days in flip flops and shorts. 
                Since owning an island was way too expensive, she decided moving to hot-humid Houston was the answer. Kerri taught Physical Education 
                and was the founding Athletic Director at the Southwest Campus of YES Prep Public Schools. Kerri was a Maverick for eight years until she 
                made the wicked smart decision to become an Owl as the administrator for the Department of Sport Management. When she isn’t keeping her 
                rowdy faculty in line, Kerri enjoys supporting the Houston sports scene, hosting TV watch parties (Game of Thrones and Bachelor), reliving 
                her softball glory days, or indulging herself in the Houston brewery and food scenes. Kerri and her furbaby Bruin (or BruBru pup) are 
                always together and have the same amount of energy, and you'll never see them apart. They are both eager to meet anyone and everyone 
                headed towards Jones!</p>
